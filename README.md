# Periodic_Classification_LogisticR(PCL) - Summer Intern Research Project(2021)

PCL is a Periodic Classification Logistic(PCL) algorithm that utilizes Logistic Regression to classify time series periodcity. We utilize Python, Tensorflow, pandas, numpy to deploy PCL. PCL has it's own labeling, pre-processing, and normalizing method to predict effectively and efficiently.
