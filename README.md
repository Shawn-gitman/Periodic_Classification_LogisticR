# Periodic_Classification_LogisticR(PCL) - Summer Intern Research Project

PCL is a Periodic Classification algorithm that utilizes Logistic Regression. We utilize Python, Tensorflow, pandas, numpy to deploy PCL and pre-processing. PCL has it's own dataset preparing, labeling, pre-processing, and normalizing method to predict time series periodcity.
