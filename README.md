# Periodic_Classification_LogisticR(PCL) - Summer Intern Research Project(2021)

PCL(Periodic Classification Logistic) is a binary classification algorithm that utilizes Logistic Regression to classify time series periodcity. We utilize Python, Tensorflow, pandas, and numpy to deploy PCL. PCL has it's own labeling, pre-processing, and normalizing method to predict periodcity effectively.

# Definition of Periodcity

Time-series is divided into two classes, periodcity and non-periodcity. Periodcity has regular seasonality without noise or pollution.
